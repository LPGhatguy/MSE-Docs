# SPACE ADVENTURER'S GUIDEBOOK
Hello, traveler! By purchasing this guidebook, you've taken your first step to being a real life SPACE ADVENTURER!

Keep this manual close at hand!

## NAVIGATING
If you're somewhere with gravity, like a planet or a large ship, you can walk! By default, you use `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` to do this. You can also jump using `SPACE` and crouch using `C`!

If you don't have gravity, you can use your jetpack to move around! Press `Q` to toggle it. With your jetpack, you can still use `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` as usual, but `SPACE` will push you upwards, and `C` will bring you back down.

Look around using `LEFT MOUSE` and you're off!

## COMMAND INTERFACE
There's more to being a SPACE ADVENTURER than just moving around, of course!

Press `ALT` to bring up the command interface, which will give you more options. This is also useful if you forget hotkeys to perform certain actions.

Additionally, your visor will show you context-based keys when near certain objects. When near a panel of buttons, your visor will superimpose the keys you should press to activate each button. Wow!
